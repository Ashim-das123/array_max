hello guys how are you doing..

i hope all of you are doing well and healthy !!!


I love writing about what’s happening across the globe and giving my take on it. I often talk with others about what’s happening, which turns into long talks… exciting talks.

I’ve always wanted to write blog articles, but I never really went for it until now.
I mainly write my opinions about global news,
but I also like to write about Tech! My writing style is primarily conversational, making it easy to follow.
